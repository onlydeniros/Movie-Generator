# Movie-Generator

**Foundation**

*A website/app that searches for movies*

A website/app that allows users to search for movies based on genre (and other parameters possibly (future feature to be added)) to simplified and eliminate the tedious, time consuming act of looking up movies and not being able to find all possible movies in a particular genre. Technology used in this project are Bootstrap,HTML,CSS,Jquery, Javascript and Google Fonts.
